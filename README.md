Performance test suite for the `CUSTOMS_MANAGE_AUTHORITIES_FRONTEND - (service provides an interface which allows a client to manage access to their accounts`) using [performance-test-runner](https://github.com/hmrc/performance-test-runner) under the hood.


# Pre-requisites

Make sure the following tools:technologies and configurations are in place before running tests:

# Running the Performance tests

## Before executing the tests, ensure you have:
- Appropriate [drivers installed](#installing-local-driver-binaries) - to run tests against locally installed Browser
- Clone the repository and pull the latest changes
- Required service dependencies are running via Service Manager `sm2 -start CUSTOMS_FINANCIALS_ALL`


## Run the test against local environment

### smoke Test

It might be useful to try the journey with one user to check that everything works fine before running the full performance test
```
sbt -Dperftest.runSmokeTest=true -DrunLocal=true gatling:test 
```
### Entire suite
```
sbt -DrunLocal=true gatling:test 
```

## Run the test against staging environment

### smoke Test

```
sbt -Dperftest.runSmokeTest=true -DrunLocal=false gatling:test
```

### Entire suite

To run a full performance test against staging environment, run the Jenkins job [customs-manage-authorities-performance-tests](https://performance.tools.staging.tax.service.gov.uk/job/CDS/job/Financials/job/customs-manage-authorities-performance-tests/)

## Run test using Jenkins
- To execute the smoke test in local environment using Jenkins, run the `run_smoke_tests_local.sh` script or `./run_smoke_tests_local.sh`
- To execute the entire test suite locally using Jenkins, run the `run_performance_tests_local.sh` script or `./run_performance_tests_local.sh`
- To execute the code formatter for Scala using Jenkins, run the `run_format_and_deps.sh` script or `./run_format_and_deps.sh`

## Logging

The template uses [logback.xml](src/test/resources) to configure log levels. The default log level is *WARN*. This can be updated to use a lower level for example *TRACE* to view the requests sent and responses received during the test.


# Source code formatting
### Scalafmt
This repository uses [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/), a code formatter for Scala. The formatting rules configured for this repository are defined within [.scalafmt.conf](.scalafmt.conf).
- To apply formatting to this repository using the configured rules in [.scalafmt.conf](.scalafmt.conf) execute `sbt scalafmtAll`
- To check files have been formatted as expected execute ` sbt scalafmtCheckAll scalafmtSbtCheck`
- [Visit the official Scalafmt documentation to view a complete list of tasks which can be run.](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/docs/installation.html#task-keys)
